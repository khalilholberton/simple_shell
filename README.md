====> I advice you to RTFM to have more informations about this system calls and funtions calls :)

Write a UNIX command line interpreter.

    Usage: simple_shell

Your Shell should:

    Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
    The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
    The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
    The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
    If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
    Handle errors.
    You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)

You don’t have to:

    use the PATH
    implement built-ins
    handle special characters : ", ', `, \, *, &, #
    be able to move the cursor
    handle commands with arguments

II/ Second step


Handle command lines with arguments.

III/ Third Step


 Handle the PATH

Some information that should help : A path, the general form of the name of a file or directory, specifies a unique location in a file system. A path points to a file system location by following the directory tree hierarchy expressed in a string of characters in which path components, separated by a delimiting character, represent each directory.

IV/ Fourth step


    Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
    Usage: exit
    You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in exit

V/ Fifth step

 Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment

Some information that should help : Environment variables are not specific to the C language, any program that runs on your system has a set of predefined environment variables. ... When your C program runs, the kernel passes control to the main function which has the signature: int main(int argc, char **argv)
